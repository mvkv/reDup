# reDup: A Web App to Find and Delete Duplicate Images in Google Drive

reDup is a web app that helps you find and delete duplicate and similar images in your Google Drive.Â 

It has two modes: similar images and exact images. It uses the CLIP library by OpenAI to compare images and identify those that are visually similar, and difference hash to identify exact duplicates.
It also lets you select which images to delete and moves them to the trash bin.
